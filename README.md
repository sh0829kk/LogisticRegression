#Logistic Regression
#Performs discrete, real, and gentle logistic regression model under both initial model and model with L2 norm regularization.
#The package provides solving algorithm includes three types of algorithms, namely gradient descent method, accelerated gradient descent method and Newton method. #Provide with functions can simply output confusion matrix, evaluation indicators and visualize descent process.
